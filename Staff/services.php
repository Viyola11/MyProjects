                <p>
                    Dr. Varghese Moolan, the founder of Moolans Group, opened his first warehouse at Al-khobar Saudi
					Arabia during 1987 striking a Partnership with Mr. Khalid Al-Saleh, and started the distribution of grocery products in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, followed by the formation of an Exporting Company in India under the name and style of Moolans International, a partnership firm, inducting his parents as partners, and executed the first export of grocery products to Saudi Arabia during May 1987. The second shipment was executed during 1989.
             		 As a feather on the crown of these business activities, a charitable organization, ‘Varghese Moolan Foundation’ has been set up, extending various charitable projects to the needy. Marking the 30th year of Excellence, Moolans Group, in association with Apollo Hospital Group, Chennai, launched the “Touch A Heart” project, under which 60 poor paediatric heart patients were given full treatment including heart surgery during early 2015. More over a house was fully built for an under-privileged family; 25 poor brides were helped substantially for getting wed-locked and 1,000 spice & rice-kits were distributed among the people below poverty line.
					Dr. Varghese Moolan, the founder of Moolans group, believes that it is the duty of every human being to be thankful to God by sharing a part of the blessings HE has bestowed upon us, with the less privileged and Moolans Group is committed to distribute a certain percentage of profit every year for charitable projects.
